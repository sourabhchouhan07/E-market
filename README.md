# Introduction
Idea / Problem

We thought about how can we help the local vendor earn in a pandemic situation and also have a place in the e-commerce market.


Proposed Solution

we found that if we add local shops to an app and the local customer can buy the product from that shop. he will get it very fast and at a reasonable price because he is purchasing from his locality. In this way, we can reduce the delivery time, delivery charge and other costs of a product.
